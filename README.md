# CF Onboarding Week

Onboarding Week is a self-guided exploration of the Cloud Foundry product, embarked upon with other Cloud Foundry newbies. It provides:

1. A self-paced learning environment paired with others who are learning too.
1. A coherent, if cursory, overview of a complicated product.
1. Empathy for the customer who uses that product.
1. A little knowledge of the breadth of work 70+ teams are doing around the world.

To run an Onboarding Week in your office, read the [facilitation](FACILITATING.md) docs and join the [#cf-onboarding-week](https://pivotal.slack.com/messages/cf-onboarding-week/) channel on Pivotal Slack.

## Usage
### Import stories to Tracker (from release)
1. Download latest release from the releases page
1. Use the Import CSV function to add the stories to your project with the CSV file. The account used to import the CSV file will be the requester associated with the resulting stories.

### Import stories to Tracker (from source)

## Contributing
Depending on personal preferance, either edit stories in the .prolific text files themselves or convert the prolific file to a CSV and upload it to a temporary Tracker project. The second one takes more time, but removes the risk of accidental prolific syntax errors.
