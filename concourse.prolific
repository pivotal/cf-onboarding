Deploy Concourse with BOSH
### What?
Okay, the training wheels are coming **off**. This Concourse deployment is gonna be you + the same docs anyone else uses ("whhaaaaaat?" "I know, they grow up so fast!"). But first, a little preamble:

Concourse is a Pivotal-sponsored, pipeline-based, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) system. The "pipelines" are a collection of [three core concepts (jobs, tasks, and resources)](http://concourse.ci/concepts.html) that you'll learn more about in upcoming stories. While CI may call to mind test automation, Pivotal teams use it for so much more than that. Take a stroll around the office and check out the jobs up on the CI screens to get a general idea of how broadly we use it to automate all that is automate-able.

### How?
If you've been doing the Local Development track, spin up a local Concourse VM with Vagrant **[by following these instructions](http://concourse.ci/vagrant.html)**.

If you're been doing the GCP Development track then you already have a BOSH Director, a cloud-config, and at least one stemcell, so to spin up a full Concourse deployment all you have to do is prepare your deployent manifest. You can follow **[these instructions](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader/blob/master/docs/concourse.md)** to set it up and BOSH deploy, but as per the yooj there are a few changes...
1. `bbl` only supports one load balancer at a time so you'll have to delete your CF load balancer before continuing. Bye bye, CF!
1. You'll need to create a new domain and TLS cert following the same instructions as you did when deploying Cloud Foundry.

### Troubleshooting
1. Is your `tls_bind_port: 443` property nested within the `properties` section of the `atc` job?
1. Did you remember to include `https://` in the domain provided under the `external_url` of the `atc` job?
1. Are you visiting the `https://` address in your browser?
1. If you hit an IP quota, go to Home > IAM & Admin > Quotas in your GCP dashboard and click the ✏  button. This will take you to a form where you can request an increased quota.
1. If this ends up being frustrating in a "please, please don't make me do another minute" kind of way, no sweat. Don't waste time on a story you're not getting anything out of, just _Choose Your Own Adventure_ your way out of it by **[spinning up a local VM with Vagrant](http://concourse.ci/vagrant.html)**. Either way, same result →

Download and hook up your Concourse CLI
### What?
Now that you have Concourse deployed, the first thing you'll want to do is download the `fly` CLI and authenticate with your target. This is done with the `fly login` command. The login command serves double duty: it authenticates with a given endpoint  and saves it under a more convenient name. The name and token are stored in ~/.flyrc (though you shouldn't really edit the file manually).

### How?
1. Download the `fly` CLI from the "no pipelines configured" page.
1. Move it to your computer's $PATH and make it executable.
1. Run `fly login --help` for instructions to login to Concourse.

### Expected Result
You successfully enter your credentials and the CLI prints "target saved."

Create a pipeline with a single job
### What?
Every great Concourse behemoth of the 21st century started in the same place as yours is about to: with an empty `pipeline.yml`. You can kick it off with as little as a single, manually-triggered job.

### How?
1. Set up a `jobs:` section.
1. Define a **[job](https://concourse.ci/concepts.html#jobs)** with a name and a [plan](http://concourse.ci/build-plans.html).
1. Give the job a task that you define inline, in the pipeline itself (this is good to know how to do to test new configurations quickly).
1. "fly" your pipeline using the `fly` CLI.

### Expected Result
A job that always goes green. How idyllic.

Add Git resource to pipeline
### What?
A  **[resource](http://concourse.ci/concepts.html#resources)** is any entity that can be checked for new versions, pulled down at a specific version, and/or pushed up to idempotently create new versions. A few of the usual suspects are [listed here](http://concourse.ci/resource-types.html). They include a number of ideas that you're used to thinking of in terms of versioning (`git resource`, `git-release resource`, `tracker resource`, etc.), but also a few that you might not be, like `time`.

The [`git resource`](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource) tracks the commits in a git repository and, though I have no numbers on this, I expect it's the most commonly used Concourse resource. And you can have one of your very own!

### How?
Create a repo to house your Concourse code (`pipeline.yml` etc.) and set up a [git resource](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource) that fetches it. It will be useful to have access to this once we add tasks and a Dockerfile that you'll want to reference in your pipeline. Move your inline task to a yaml file and either a Bash or Ruby script in that repo.

### Expected Result
A one job, one resource pipeline that is always green.

Add docker-image resource to pipeline
### What?
Another popular Concourse resource is the **[`docker-image` resource](https://github.com/concourse/docker-image-resource)**. It's useful for creating a reproducible environment for your tests and builds with all of the dependencies a growing pipeline needs to succeed.

### How?
1. Write a simple Dockerfile.
1. Upload it to the DockerHub registry (if you do not have an account, create one at this point).
1. Set up the `docker-image` resource to fetch it.
1. Build the image and use it to do something cool.
